 * This class manages SWT resources. It manages reference-counted instances of resources
 * such as Fonts, Images, and Colors, and allows them to be accessed using descriptors.
 * Everything allocated through the registry should also be disposed through the registry.
 * Since the resources are shared and reference counted, they should never be disposed
 * directly.
 * <p>
 * ResourceManager handles correct allocation and disposal of resources. It differs from 
 * the various JFace *Registry classes, which also map symbolic IDs onto resources. In 
 * general, you should use a *Registry class to map IDs onto descriptors, and use a 
 * ResourceManager to convert the descriptors into real Images/Fonts/etc.
