 * directly.

 * ResourceManager handles correct allocation and disposal of resources. It differs from 
 * the various JFace *Registry classes, which also map symbolic IDs onto resources. In 
 * general, you should use a *Registry class to map IDs onto descriptors, and use a 
 * ResourceManager to convert the descriptors into real Images/Fonts/etc.
