<body>
<p>
This package contains some of the utility types from the eclipse runtime.
These have been copied from the org.eclipse.core.runtime plug-in
in order to satisfy JFace's dependencies on the eclipse runtime's
utility classes when running JFace outside of the eclipse runtime.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, slight modifications were made in order to eliminate coupling
to other parts of the eclipse runtime.
